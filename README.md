- **Insight**: Tier-wise distribution of sales (e.g., Tier 3 outlets have the highest sales in both Regular and Low Fat items compared to other two).
### 4. **Total Sales by Outlet Establishment**  
- **Objective**: Evaluate how the age or type of outlet establishment influences total sales
- **Chart**: Line Chart  
- **Insight**: Almost all outlets have similar sales irrespective of age except the ones that were established before 2000  

### 5. **Sales by Outlet Size**  
- **Objective**: Correlate outlet size (Small/Medium/High) with sales.  
- **Chart**: Donut/Pie Chart
